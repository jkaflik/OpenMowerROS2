## Overview

This is a ROS2 Jazzy port of the [OpenMower ROS](https://github.com/ClemensElflein/open_mower_ros/) software. The OpenMower project is a robotic lawn mower that is open source and open hardware.

The initial goal of this project is to get learn about robot development using ROS2. The long term goal is to build a robotic lawn mower using the OpenMower hardware, but with longer term goals of adding features such as pairing robots, obstacle avoidance etc.
